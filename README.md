  Welcome! 

We are a 4-person high school team from high school in Cracow, which decided to take part in the CanSat competition.
We designed and built the minisatellite the size of a can.
In CanSat Poland finals our can was lunched from 2,5 km. We are delighted to announce that we won CanSat Poland 2020/2021 and we are going to represend our country in Europen finals.

Our project calls OSA (in Polish “Opadający Satelita Atmosferyczny” is loosely translated into “Falling Atmospheric Satellite”) and team - OSATeam

Our project is fully open-source, and we are opened to suggestions and collaboration
