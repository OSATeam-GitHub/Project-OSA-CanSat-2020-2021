#  Project OSA

OSA a is minisatellite the size of a can designed to participate in the ESA cansat 2021 competition 🛰️📡. Our project calls OSA (in Polish “Opadający Satelita Atmosferyczny” is loosely translated into “Falling Atmospheric Satellite”) and team - [OSATeam](https://www.osacan.eu/)

OSA can be launched from a drone or racket and while falling it has two missions. Primary is to take the measurements of air temperature, pressure, humidity and sand it via LoRa radio to the ground station. The secondary  is to take five air samples 🧪. 

Among other OSA has built-in GPS so after lunch it can be found easily.
